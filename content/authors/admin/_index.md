Mickey is a Robotics and Autonomous systems senior research fellow with the Deparment of Civil, Environment and Geomatic Engineering at University College London working on transitioning and developing research photogrammetry and surveying metrology systems for deployment in aerospace manufacturing. This primarily revolves around investigating the viability of ROS2 for industrial use and implementing an infrastructure for large scale sensor networks for multiple different tasks, including equipment tracking and high accuracy multi-vehicle ground and aerial robot inspection and measurment.

He completed his PhD in 2023 at Bristol Robotics Laboratory (BRL) and the University of Bristol on the FARSCOPE CDT program supervised by Professor Arthur Richards and sponsored by the Toshiba Bristol Research and Innovation Laboratory. The PhD focused on failure-aware multi-drone algorithms for coverage path planning for application such as building inspection, in particular how guarantees can be provided despite vehicle failures. During this time he also developed a portable development and deployment infrastructure for multi-UAV experimentation for the BRL Flight Arena inspired by advances in cloud computing. He graudated in 2018 with a first from Joint Mathematics and Computer Science at Imperial College London with a masters project supervised by Dr Aldo Faisal on Real Time Semantic Segmentation with SLAM for Gaze Intention Decoding.

In addition to research, he is passionate when it comes to public engagement of robotics research having previously developed games for the UK Festival of Robotics, and is an avid advocate for better software engineering education throughout all engineering discplines. Outside of research, he is an active pianist, having previously performed Rach 2 with live orchestra, and an avid saxophonist.
