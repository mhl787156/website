abstract: Graceful degradation is a desirable trait in applications that require coverage
  with real, failure-prone robots. This paper uses methods informed by Reliability
  Engineering to study the Reliability-Aware Multi-Agent Coverage Path Planning (RA-MCPP)
  problem. An augmented stochastic framework is applied to evaluate a strategy's probability
  of mission completion (PoC) on 3D lattice graph environments. A Genetic Algorithm
  optimisation approach is then proposed to find RA-MCPP path plans which maximise
  PoC. It is shown that the GA provides good solutions at reasonable runtimes, complementing
  previous approaches which focused on global opti-mality guarantees at the cost of
  massive computation, especially for medium and large environments.
