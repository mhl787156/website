abstract: Multi-Agent Systems have the potential advantage of graceful degradation
  over Single-Agent systems. This is a desirable trait in applications that require
  area coverage with failure-prone UAVs. This paper uses methods informed by Reliability
  Engineering to study this formally by using a new stochastic framework which evaluates
  a strategy’s probability of task completion. Based on this analysis, an integer
  linear programming formulation of the problem is then shown to provide almost optimal
  strategies at a fraction of the computational cost of brute force methods.
