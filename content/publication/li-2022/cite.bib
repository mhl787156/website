 abstract = {A major challenge of UAV research is facilitating the
local development, deployment and testing of multi-UAV systems.
Inspired by cloud computing, this work proposes Starling, a fullstack, compositional, containerised UAV infrastructure utilising
ROS2, Gazebo, PX4, Docker and Kubernetes. By modelling
individual UAVs as nodes in a compute cluster, our architecture
is natively scalable, fault tolerant and allows for the flexible
deployment of custom applications in both simulation and in
reality. These technologies allow us to facilitate reproducible
research while provide a lower barrier of entry for potential
users, as well as the reuse of flight hardware for multiple
projects. A multi-UAV path planning case study is presented to
demonstrate the streamlined workflow of developing a controller
from simulation to reality.},
