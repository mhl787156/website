abstract: A major challenge of UAV research is facilitating the local development,
  deployment and testing of multi-UAV systems. Inspired by cloud computing, this work
  proposes Starling, a fullstack, compositional, containerised UAV infrastructure
  utilising ROS2, Gazebo, PX4, Docker and Kubernetes. By modelling individual UAVs
  as nodes in a compute cluster, our architecture is natively scalable, fault tolerant
  and allows for the flexible deployment of custom applications in both simulation
  and in reality. These technologies allow us to facilitate reproducible research
  while provide a lower barrier of entry for potential users, as well as the reuse
  of flight hardware for multiple projects. A multi-UAV path planning case study is
  presented to demonstrate the streamlined workflow of developing a controller from
  simulation to reality.
