abstract: Multi-Agent Systems have the potential advantage of graceful
  degradation over Single-Agent systems. This is a desirable trait in
  applications that require area coverage with failure-prone UAVs. This paper
  uses methods informed by Reliability Engineering to study this formally by
  using a new stochastic framework which evaluates a strategyâ€™s probability of
  task completion. Based on this analysis, an integer linear programming
  formulation of the problem is then shown to provide almost optimal strategies
  at a fraction of the computational cost of brute force methods.
